# Operations Efficiency Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains a sample analytics workflow that demonstrates how to build an operations efficiency dashboard. It uses Python to generate a synthetic dataset mimicking operational metrics, calculates summary statistics, and visualizes key indicators in a bar chart. The goal is to showcase how data can be transformed into actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Features
- **Synthetic data generation**: Creates a mock dataset with fields such as timestamp, process type, execution time, and status to simulate real-world operational logs.
- **Data cleaning and summarization**: Cleans the data and computes aggregate metrics, including average execution time and process counts by type and status.
- **Visualization**: Produces a bar chart illustrating average execution time per process type, which can be the foundation for an interactive dashboard.
- **Reproducible**: All analysis lives in a single Python script (`operations_efficiency_dashboard.py`) and the generated image (`operations_delay_rate.png`).

## Repository Structure
- `operations_efficiency_dashboard.py`: Main script that generates synthetic data, processes it, and creates the visualization.
- `operations_delay_rate.png`: Output image showing average execution time per process type.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3 (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/ray1131313131/operations-efficiency-dashboard.git
   cd operations-efficiency-dashboard
2. **Install dependencies**:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
3. **Run the script**:
   python operations_efficiency_dashboard.py
   The script will generate the `operations_delay_rate.png` image in the project directory.


## Why This Project
Operational efficiency is critical for any organization, and visualizing key metrics helps stakeholders identify bottlenecks and make informed decisions. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of data generation, analysis, and visualization in a compact, reproducible example.
